              <div class="about-us-info-text">
                  <p class="about-p1">Chloé Dupont's journey into the world of bicycles started at a young age, with her father
                      instilling in her a love for the sport by taking her to watch the Tour de France annually.
                      Those moments not only ignited a passion for cycling in her heart but also fostered a deep
                      bond between father and daughter that would endure. The sights, sounds, and spirit of the
                      race became a cherished part of her upbringing, shaping her future in unforeseen ways.</p>

                  <p class="about-p2">Tragedy struck when Chloé lost her father to a sudden stroke at the tender age of 16.
                      Overwhelmed by grief, she turned to cycling as a means of coping with her loss. However,
                      fate dealt her a cruel blow when an unfortunate accident left her unable to continue riding.
                      Despite the setback, Chloé's determination and resilience refused to be quenched. It was
                      during this challenging period that she discovered a new avenue to channel her passion for
                      bicycles — the intricate craft of their creation.</p>

                  <p class="about-p3">Undeterred by her inability to ride, Chloé immersed herself in the world of bicycle
                      craftsmanship and design. Fascinated by the diverse array of bicycles and their unique
                      characteristics, she embarked on a journey to share her newfound knowledge and enthusiasm
                      with others. This journey culminated in the establishment of her own e-commerce shop, where
                      she offers a curated selection of high-quality bicycles. Today, her business has flourished,
                      earning widespread acclaim and support. Partnering with the renowned CANYON//SRAM Generation
                      women's cycling team, led by the esteemed Ricarda Bauernfeind, Chloé continues to elevate the
                      cycling experience for enthusiasts worldwide, honoring the legacy of her father while forging
                      her own path in the world of bicycles.</p>
